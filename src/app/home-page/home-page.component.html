        <h4 style="font: 400 15px Lato, sans-serif;line-height: 1.8;color: #818181;">There are many food storage mistakes that can increase food waste and food safety risks. Consider the below Three tips to reduce leaks, cross-contamination, freezer burn, accelerated spoilage, and more.</h4>
        <p style="font: 400 15px Lato, sans-serif;line-height: 1.8;color: #818181;"><b>1. </b>Handle food safely. Food cannot be above 41 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 4 hours total, so thawing and prepping should be completed within this window of time. To properly thaw freezer food, it can be transferred to the refrigerator
            or put under running water that is below 70 degrees. Food that is cooked should be cooled to 70 degrees within 2 hours and cooled to 38 degrees (refrigeration temperature) within 6 hours. It’s best to label food items with the type of food,
            the date it was prepared, and a use by date if it is to be stored and consumed after 24 hours.</p>
        <p style="font: 400 15px Lato, sans-serif;line-height: 1.8;color: #818181;"><b>2. </b>Arrange food properly. Prepared foods, such as deli salads, pre-sliced ready-to-eat items, and cakes, should be stored at the top of the refrigerator, followed from top to bottom by raw produce, raw seafood, raw red meat, raw ground
            meat, and then raw poultry. Separating foods in this manner reduces the risk of raw meat leaking onto and contaminating other food products. </p>
        <p style="font: 400 15px Lato, sans-serif;line-height: 1.8;color: #818181;"><b>3. </b>Pay attention to food storage temperatures. If food is not stored at the proper temperature, it can spoil faster and be unsafe to consume. Perishable food should be kept at or below 41 degrees Fahrenheit in the refrigerator and at or
            below -4 degrees Fahrenheit in the freezer. If food was purchased from a refrigerated section, it should not be stored outside of the refrigerator. It’s also best to pay attention to labels of food purchased outside of refrigerated areas,
            as they may need to be stored in the refrigerator after being opened.
